    <div>There once was a brown fox</div>
    <div>He lived in a little brown box.</div>
    <div>One day he saw a few dogs sleeping</div>
    <div>He went over to give them his greeting.</div>
    <div>The dogs, startled by his presence, began to chase him</div>
    <div>The fox ran, his escape was slim</div>
    <div>He ran through the hay and lived to fox another day.</div>
