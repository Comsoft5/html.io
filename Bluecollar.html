          <h2><u>What are they?</u></h2>
          <div>Those who perform heavy physical labor are referred to as "blue-collar workers."</div>
          <div>These workers are usually found in the manufacturing, construction, mining, agricultural, or maintenance industries.</div>

          <h2><u>Why are they called Blue-Collar Jobs</u></h2>
          <div>The phrase first appeared in the 1920s, when blue-collar workers were distinguished from white-collar office workers by donning darker-colored attire.</div>
          <div>Probably because Blue-Collar workers got dirtier than white collar workers.</div>

          <div>But on a more serious note without blue-collar workers, society would lack the essential services and infrastructure that allow us to live comfortably.</div>
          <div>Our economy, cities, and daily lives would be in chaos. Blue-collar jobs aren't just importantâ€”they are the foundation of modern society.</div>
